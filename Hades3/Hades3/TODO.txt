separate logic in SimulationCore.Draw() into separate, smaller methods.

add growthRange to bloodvessels

make traveling through blood vessels.

remove magic numbers

space bar vs. start/stop buttons




Check for tissue collision upon creation

fix possible memory leak that might happen when cell is deleted

make move a boolean, mutateable, behavior

reintroduce orbit camera












#old

re-introduce sectors to handle angiogenesis...
sector size... 1 parameter for cube sectors: sectorWidth

alternative to sector-based angiogenesis...
every x turns, cell does the following:
	find closest endothelial cell -- search through all (or can do every 2 or 3 for optimization) endothelial cells in sector.
		shouldn't be more than a couple hundred
	determine path from endothelial cell to the cell, path shouldn't be more than 100 units long
	while searching for path, count the number of cells along the path, if greater than certain number then request additional pipe

cell needs to keep track of
	closest pipe section (endothelial cell)
	path from this pipe to the cell

subroutines required
	EndothelialCell findClosestEndothelialCellTo(Vector3 location);
	Path findPath(Vector3 location1, Vector3 location2);
	int countCellsAlongPath(Path p);

environment keeps track of all endothelial cells within each sector, and between sectors.
these cells are kept in a linked list (technically a tree because each cell can have more than 1 child)
